___Question 9.___ Often times, algorithms are aimed at the wrong target to begin with. The result is a "label choice bias," arising from a mismatch between the ideal target the algorithm should be predicting, and a biased proxy variable the algorithm is actually predicting. Here we see some evidence of this bias: compare models 3 & 4 with models 1 & 2/5 & 6. We can see that the shape of the curves in risk score intervals (40, 75) is different, meaning that if we chose models 1 & 2/5 & 6 over models 3 & 4 we would get completely different results, categorizing a significantly different fraction of patients as with increased risk. Comparing the duos in each model category, along with our tables in question 7, we can also see that this is likely not due to the inclusion or exclusion of the race variable.
